# recipes-project
My first project
So far I spent 3 frustrating hours trying to figure out why my files weren't showing up in github after I committed them, so I went for a walk. Mid-walk I remembered I needed to actually git push the files. I went home immediately and tried it and I have never facepalmed myself so hard in my life. 

Might need more practice on links
